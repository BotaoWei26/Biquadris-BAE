restart fucks up the players score

heavy board automatically 2downs the block when it spawns

score not reflected in graphic display? (needs more investigation)

level 4 doesnt' spawn bitch block [FIXED]

calling norandom [fname] finishes the current file stream before running the blocks from [fname]]

LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAKS everywhere [FIXED]
